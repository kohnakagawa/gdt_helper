# Gdt helper

Ghidra has "Parse C Source" feature to add new structs or function types to "Data Type Manager."
Using this feature, we can add the types to "Data Type Manager" by writing C header file.

However, this is not easily performed as expected.
Without setting "Parse Configuration" properly, Ghidra cannot parse a relatively simple C header file.
Although several "Parse Configurations" are provided by default, this does not work properly :(.

Gdt helper solves this problem. It makes "Parse Configurations" for your environment.

## Prepare to use

Before use this script, you need to install [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) and Python (3.8) to resolve its dependencies.
Then, you can install all dependencies for running gdt\_helper script in the following commands.

```
$ poetry shell
$ poetry update
$ poetry install
```

## How to use

1. Make "Parse Options" and paste it.

```bash
# Specify a compiler as an input argument. clang/gcc/x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc/i686-w64-mingw32-gcc are supported.
$ python gdt_helper.py make-parse-options clang
Please past the following output to "Parse Options"

-I/usr/local/include
-I/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/clang/11.0.0/include
-I/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/include
-I/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include
-I/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks (framework directory)
-DCONST="const"
-D__restrict__=""
-D__always_inline__="inline"
-D__gnu_inline__="inline"
-D__builtin_va_list="void *"
-DOBJC_NEW_PROPERTIES="1"
-D_LP64="1"
-D__APPLE_CC__="6000"
-D__APPLE__="1"
...
```

2. Make a source file to parse and select this file as "Source files to parse." You can also specify additional include directories.

```bash
$ python gdt_helper.py make-file-to-parse clang example/osx/mac_system.h --additional-includes /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.16.sdk/usr/include
Please add "./example/osx/mac_system.h.out" to "Source files to parse"

You also have specified additional includes as arguments
So, please add the following header includes to "Parse configuration"
-I/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.16.sdk/usr/include
```

3. Select "Parse to Program" (for importing data types to current project) or "Parse to File" (for creating gdt files)

See also [example](./example/README.md).

## Tested

- Ubuntu 20.04
- macOS Catalina

Windows is not supported. If you want to create some data types of Windows headers, you can do it via MinGW on Linux.
For more details, see [Windows example](./example/README.md).
